Section1-title: ECOFEMINISM

----

Section1-text1: “Intersectional ecofeminism also underscores the mportance of gender, race and class, interlinking feminist concerns with human oppressions within patriarchy and the exploitations of a natural environment that women are often more reliant upon but also its guardians in many cultural contexts.” — Fatimah Kelleher
