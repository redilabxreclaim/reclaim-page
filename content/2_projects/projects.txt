Project1_headline : WITCHES GARDEN

Project1_description : In our little witches garden, part of the Rote Beete Gemeinschaftsgarten in Wedding, we see the soil as a fertile ground for an activist and political approach.

We regularly host book club meetings (English & French) centered around ecofeminist literature, such as 'Sister Outsider' by Audre Lorde or 'Oneness vs. the 1%' by Vandana Shiva.
